These episodes were self-limiting and did\nnot require the interruption of therapy.\nThe median levels of serum AST and ALT fell in both groups\nafter 7 days of therapy.

Infection in pediatric cancer patients has become a concerning problem due to \nincreasing antimicrobial resistance. The goal of this study was to determine the antimicrobial \nresistance patterns of blood isolates from pediatric oncology patients in Iran to d etermine if there \nwas significant resistance to quinolones  \nMethods . Children with cancer who were admitted with or developed fever during admission to \nAliasghar Children’s Hospital or Mahak Hospitals July 2009 through June 2011 were eligible for \nenrollmen t. Two blood cultures were obtained.  Antimicrobial sensitivity test was performed for \nciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, meropenem, cefepime, and piperacillin -tazobactam on \nisolates from children who were bacteremic.  \nResults ."], "properties": {"doi": "PMC4103504", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25045453/", "subject": "question answer"}, "answer": "Not mentioned", "answer_format": {"type": "labels", "labels": ["Intravenous", "Oral", "Intramuscular", "Inhaled", "Topical"]}, "full_answer": "The route of administration of gatifloxacin in this research is Not mentioned."}
