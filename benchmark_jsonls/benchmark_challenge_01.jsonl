From this time thefluoroquinolones became the treatment of choice for typhoid fever\n[4], and were simultaneously sold widely over the counter to treat\nfever of various aetiologies. The extensive antibiotic pressure leadto the selection of single point mutations in the DNA Gyrase A ofS.\ntyphi, causing resistance to nalidixic acid (the prototype quinolone)\nand reduced susceptibility to the fluoroquinolones (but formallythese isolates are still within the Clinical Laboratory StandardInstitute (CLSI) breakpoints for susceptibility) [6]. This resulted ina poor clinical response to treatment with the older generationfluoroquinolones, ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin [7,8].\nThe World Health Organisation recommends the fluoroquin-\nolones or cefixime for the treatment of MDR typhoid fever andazithromycin, the third-generation cephalosporins, or a 10–14 daycourse of high-dose older generation fluoroquinolones (e.g.ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) for the treatment of nalidixic acidresistant typhoid fever [9].\nAzithromycin, an azalid antibiotics, has achieved excellent\nclinical results in the treatment of MDR and nalidixic acid\nresistant typhoid fever [7,8].", "The study sites and ethical approval\nThe study was conducted at three hospitals in the south of\nVietnam.\nAdult and paediatric patients were recruited at the Hospital for\nTropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, at the Dong Thap\nProvincial hospital in Cao Lanh, Dong Thap province and at the\nAn Giang Provincial hospital in Long Xuyen, An Giang province.\nThe study was approved by the Ethical and Scientific\nCommittee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh\nCity and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics\nCommittee (OXTREC), UK for all three study sites.

Many case reports and somerandomised controlled trials have described the worsening clinicalresponse to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin [8,27,28].The search for effective antibiotics to treat typhoid fever is\nimperative.\nTypically trials in typhoid fever are limited by small sample\nsizes, a recent Cochrane Report has stressed the need for large\nwell-designed trials in enteric fever [29]. The evidence from our\ntrial is strengthened by a sample size of 287 patients with cultureconfirmed typhoid fever (358 patients randomised), which we\nbelieve is so far the largest RCT performed in typhoid fever.\nBoth antibiotics also worked well for the patients with negative\nblood cultures. This is an important finding because the sensitivity\nof blood culture for the diagnosis of typhoid fever is only\napproximately 50 to 80% [9].\nLimitations of the study\nThe randomisation sequence was generated with a large block\nsize of 50, which resulted in uneven numbers in the two treatment\ngroups (186 versus 172 patients in the ITT population).\nOne possible limitation was the low rate of stool cultures positive\nforS. typhi. Faecal carriage is usually characterised by intermittent\nshedding and the stool culture for S. typhi is not very sensitive.", "Sample Size\nThe primary outcome measure for the study was the fever\nclearance time (FCT).\nPrevious studies that used azithromycin to treat typhoid fever\npatients, reported a mean fever clearance time of 130 hours [7]\nand 139 hours [8]. For gatifloxacin, clinical observations from a\nsmall number of typhoid fever patients were available andindicated a mean FCT of 76 hours. We calculated that 139\npatients with culture-confirmed typhoid fever would be needed in\neach treatment arm to detect a Hazard Ratio of 1.40 with two-\nsided alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80 [14]. Therefore, assuming a\nmedian fever clearance time of 130 hours for azithromycin, the\nsample size of 140 patients with culture-confirmed typhoid fever in\neach arm would give power of at least 0.80 to detect a difference\nbetween treatments if the fever clearance time in the gatifloxacin\ngroup was 92 hours or less.\nRandomization procedures and assignment of\nintervention (sequence generation, allocationconcealment, implementation)\nAn administrator independent from the study generated the\nrandom number sequence in Excel using RAND function.

For the 29 episodes of bacteremia, \nboth blood cultures were positive in 14 episodes and \nBACTEC alone in 15 episodes.  Ninety -one of these \n160 cases were mal e (57%). The mean age of enrolled \npatients was 82 months (SD=54.4).", "Results . Blood cultures were p ositive for 38 episodes in 169 enrolled children but 9 episodes were \nexcluded as blood cultures were thought to be contaminated,  yielding a bacteremia rate of 29/160 \n(18%). The mean age of children and the stage of malignancy did not differ between those w ith and \nwithout bacteremia. Meropenem was the most likely antibiotic to cover isolates (97%) with \ncefepime having the lowest coverage rate (21%). Quinolone coverage ranged from 63% to 76%.  \nConclusion . Quinolones may not be suitable for use as empiric therapy in febrile pediatric oncology \npatients in Iran.", "Susceptibility rates for organisms causing bacteremia in children with malignancies (N=29)(%)  \nOrganism  ciprofloxacin  moxifloxacin  gatifloxacin  meropenem  cefepime  piperacillin -\ntazobactam  \n  Streptococcus pneumoniae3 NA 3 (100%)  3 (100%)  3 (100%)  2 (67%)  NA \nCoagulase negative \nstaphylococcus10 8 (80%)  8 (80%)  9 (90%)  10 (100%)  2 (20%)  9 (90%)  \nEscherichia coli4 3 (75%)  NA 3 (75%)  4 (100%)  1 (25%)  4 (100%)  \nStaphylococcus.aureus3 1 (33%)  1 (33%)  1 (33%)  3 (100%)  1 (33%)  1 (33%)  \nPseudomonas aeruginosa1 1 (100%)  1 (100%)  1 (100%)  1 (100%)  0 0 \nCitrobacter freundii1 1 (100%)  NA 1 (100%)  1 (100%)  0 1 (100%)  \nStreptococcus viridans group2 NA 2 (100%)  2 (100%)  2 (100%)  0 2 (100%)  \nEnterococcus."], "properties": {"doi": "PMC4103504", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25045453/", "subject": "common sense"}, "answer": "Bacteremia rate; Mean age of enrolled patients; Stage of malignancy; Antibiotic coverage rates; Quinolone coverage rates.", "answer_format": {"type": "text"}}
