Many of the first line antibiotics, including the older generation fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, are failing. Objectives: We performed a randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) versus azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day) as a once daily oral dose for 7 days for the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever in children and adults in Vietnam. Methods: An open-label multi-centre randomised trial with pre-specified per protocol analysis and intention to treat analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was fever clearance time, the secondary outcome was overall treatment failure (clinical or microbiological failure, development of typhoid fever-related complications, relapse or faecal carriage of S. typhi). Principal findings: We enrolled 358 children and adults with suspected typhoid fever. There was no death in the study. 287 patients had blood culture confirmed typhoid fever, 145 patients received gatifloxacin and 142 patients received azithromycin. The median FCT was 106 hours in both treatment arms (95% Confidence Interval [CI]; 94-118 hours for gatifloxacin versus 88-112 hours for azithromycin), (logrank test p = 0.984, HR [95% CI] = 1.0 [0.80-1.26]). Overall treatment failure occurred in 13/145 (9%) patients in the gatifloxacin group and 13/140 (9.3%) patients in the azithromycin group, (logrank test p = 0.854, HR [95% CI] = 0.93 [0.43-2.0]). 96% (254/263) of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and 58% (153/263) were multidrug resistant. Conclusions: Both antibiotics showed an excellent efficacy and safety profile. Both gatifloxacin and azithromycin can be recommended for the treatment of typhoid fever particularly in regions with high rates of multidrug and nalidixic acid resistance.

For gatifloxacin, clinical observations from a\nsmall number of typhoid fever patients were available andindicated a mean FCT of 76 hours. We calculated that 139\npatients with culture-confirmed typhoid fever would be needed in\neach treatment arm to detect a Hazard Ratio of 1.40 with two-\nsided alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80 [14]. Therefore, assuming a\nmedian fever clearance time of 130 hours for azithromycin, the\nsample size of 140 patients with culture-confirmed typhoid fever in\neach arm would give power of at least 0.80 to detect a difference\nbetween treatments if the fever clearance time in the gatifloxacin\ngroup was 92 hours or less.\nRandomization procedures and assignment of\nintervention (sequence generation, allocationconcealment, implementation)\nAn administrator independent from the study generated the\nrandom number sequence in Excel using RAND function.
