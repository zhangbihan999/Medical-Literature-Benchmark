Many of the first line antibiotics, including the older generation fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, are failing. Objectives: We performed a randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) versus azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day) as a once daily oral dose for 7 days for the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever in children and adults in Vietnam. Methods: An open-label multi-centre randomised trial with pre-specified per protocol analysis and intention to treat analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was fever clearance time, the secondary outcome was overall treatment failure (clinical or microbiological failure, development of typhoid fever-related complications, relapse or faecal carriage of S. typhi). Principal findings: We enrolled 358 children and adults with suspected typhoid fever. There was no death in the study. 287 patients had blood culture confirmed typhoid fever, 145 patients received gatifloxacin and 142 patients received azithromycin. The median FCT was 106 hours in both treatment arms (95% Confidence Interval [CI]; 94-118 hours for gatifloxacin versus 88-112 hours for azithromycin), (logrank test p = 0.984, HR [95% CI] = 1.0 [0.80-1.26]). Overall treatment failure occurred in 13/145 (9%) patients in the gatifloxacin group and 13/140 (9.3%) patients in the azithromycin group, (logrank test p = 0.854, HR [95% CI] = 0.93 [0.43-2.0]). 96% (254/263) of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and 58% (153/263) were multidrug resistant. Conclusions: Both antibiotics showed an excellent efficacy and safety profile. Both gatifloxacin and azithromycin can be recommended for the treatment of typhoid fever particularly in regions with high rates of multidrug and nalidixic acid resistance. The cost of a 7-day treatment course of gatifloxacin is approximately one third of the cost of azithromycin in Vietnam.

The emergence ofantimicrobial drug resistance in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S.\ntyphi) is a major problem particularly in South East Asia and the\nIndian sub-continent and challenges our current treatment options[2–4].", "question_2_node_0": "Adverse events\nBoth treatments were well tolerated. One adverse event related\nto azithromycin was reported, a maculopapular rash that occurredafter the first dose of treatment. Azithromycin was discontinued\nimmediately and the patient was treated with ceftriaxone.\nGastrointestinal side-effects (change in consistency and frequen-\ncy of stools) that were probably typhoid fever related were\nrelatively frequent in both treatment arms at the start of treatment.In the gatifloxacin group, one patient experienced vomiting on day\n2 and day 3 and one patient diarrhoea (4 episodes/day) on day 4\nand day 5 of treatment. These episodes were self-limiting and did\nnot require the interruption of therapy.\nThe median levels of serum AST and ALT fell in both groups\nafter 7 days of therapy. In the PP group, the median post-\ntreatment AST was 46.35 U/L (range 12.8–217.5) in the\ngatifloxacin arm and 45 U/L (range 5–358) in the azithromycin\narm. The median post-treatment ALT fell to 46.8 U/L (range\n7.4–278) and 49.9 (1.1–494), respectively. In the culture-negativepatients, the median post-treatment AST was 44.8 U/L (range\n12–654) and ALT was 40 U/L (range 10–424.4).\nAntimicrobial susceptibilities of S. typhi and S. paratyphi\nA isolates\nFrom the PP population, 282 (98%) S. typhi and 5 (2%) S.\nparatyphi A strains were isolated.", "question_2_node_1": "adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) and Cornfield’s 95% confidence\ninterval [15] were calculated to show the relative risk of developing\nindividual secondary outcomes (clinical, microbiological failure,\ntyphoid fever-related complications) in the gatifloxacin group\ncompared to the azithromycin group.\nFever clearance time, time to relapse and time to overall failure\nwere analysed using survival methods. The time to overall failure\nequaled the earliest time individual failure was recorded.

Many case reports and somerandomised controlled trials have described the worsening clinicalresponse to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin [8,27,28].The search for effective antibiotics to treat typhoid fever is\nimperative.\nTypically trials in typhoid fever are limited by small sample\nsizes, a recent Cochrane Report has stressed the need for large\nwell-designed trials in enteric fever [29]. The evidence from our\ntrial is strengthened by a sample size of 287 patients with cultureconfirmed typhoid fever (358 patients randomised), which we\nbelieve is so far the largest RCT performed in typhoid fever.\nBoth antibiotics also worked well for the patients with negative\nblood cultures. This is an important finding because the sensitivity\nof blood culture for the diagnosis of typhoid fever is only\napproximately 50 to 80% [9].\nLimitations of the study\nThe randomisation sequence was generated with a large block\nsize of 50, which resulted in uneven numbers in the two treatment\ngroups (186 versus 172 patients in the ITT population).\nOne possible limitation was the low rate of stool cultures positive\nforS. typhi.

The mean age of enrolled \npatients was 82 months (SD=54.4). The mean age of \ncases with bacteremia was 71.5 months (SD=55.6) and \nfor those with negative blood cultures or contaminated \nblood cultures was 84.3 months (SD=57.8) (P value \n=0.27).   \nThree enrolled children had two episodes of \nbacteremia during different admissions. These were not \nthought to be relapses or recurrences as two of the \nchildren had different organisms each time and the \nthird child had the same organism but with different \nsuscept ibilities.  \nThe 160 children had 19 different types of \nmalignancies ( Table 1 ). The types of malignancies in \nenrolled patients with and without bacteremia are \nshown in Table 1  (P value=0.002). Bacteremia with \nfever was especially common with acute myeloid \nleukemia (6 of 16 episodes; 37%). There was no \nsignificant difference in stage of malignancy between \nthose with and without bacteremia (P value=0.14).  \nThe organisms causing bacteremia are shown in \nTable 2  with coagulase negative staphylococci causing \n10 of the 29 cases (34%).The coverage rate was highest \nfor meropenem (97%) with cefepime having the lowest", "question_12_node_2": "Standard methods were used for identification of \norganisms.  Children who had positive blood culture s \nfor common skin contaminants were considered to be \nbacteremic only if both samples were positive for the \nsame microorganism.  Antimicrobial sensitivity test was \nperformed for ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, \ngatifloxacin, meropenem, cefepime, and piperacillin -\ntazobactam according to Clinical and Laboratory \nStandards Institute (CLSI) methods using the standard \ndisk diffusion method from MAST Co (Mast Co, \nMerseyside, UK). A questionnaire was completed for \neach patient on admission and data was analyzed by \nSPSS s oftware version -16 using appropriate statistical \nmethods.  \nData are presented as numbers and proportions. \nContinuous variables are presented as mean and \nstandard deviation.  \n \nResults . There were 173 febrile episodes during the \nperiod of study. Parental conse nt was not obtained for \n4 of these episodes. Blood cultures were positive for 38 \nof the remaining 169 episodes but 9 episodes were \nexcluded from further analysis as only a single blood \nculture was positive for a common skin contaminant, \nyielding a proven b acteremia rate of 29/160 ([18%). \nAll 9 suspected contaminated blood cultures were from \nBACTEC alone. For the 29 episodes of bacteremia, \nboth blood cultures were positive in 14 episodes and \nBACTEC alone in 15 episodes.  Ninety -one of these \n160 cases were mal e (57%).

The mean age of children and the stage of malignancy did not differ between those w ith and \nwithout bacteremia. Meropenem was the most likely antibiotic to cover isolates (97%) with \ncefepime having the lowest coverage rate (21%). Quinolone coverage ranged from 63% to 76%.  \nConclusion .
