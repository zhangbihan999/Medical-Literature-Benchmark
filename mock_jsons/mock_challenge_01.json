            "Houston, Texas llAEMOPHILus INFLUENZAE TYPE B iS the most com- mon organism responsible for bacterial meningitis in children younger than 5 years. During the past 5 years in the United States, approximately 20% of H I B isolates have been resistant to ampicillin, t In some areas of the country, strains of HIB resistant to chloramphenicol have been reported? Furthermore, there have been isolates of ltlB resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol concomitant- ly?. 4 Therefore, alternative antibiotics must be available in the event that ampicillin-chloramphenicol-resistant strains of I{IB increase in incidence. Moxalactam is an one- oxa-/~-lactam antibiotic that is highly active in vitro against ItlB and penetrates into cerebrospinal fluid effec- tively? -s Previous studies have demonstrated that moxalac- tam is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of non-central nervous system infections caused by HIB in From the Departments of Pediatrics and Otorhinolaryngology, Baylor College of Medicine.

One of 63 (1.6%) children with a CSF glucose concentration > 10 mg/dl, compared with four of 22 (18%) with an initial CSF glucose concentration < 10 mg/dl, had severe hearing deficits (Fisher exact test, P = 0.016). One of 72 children with CSF PRP concentrations up to 1.28 tag/ml and four of 8 with values between 2.56 and 10.24 t~g/ml had severe hearing loss (Fisher exact test, P = 0.002). DISCUSSION Previous investigations have demonstrated that moxa- lactam is an effective agent in the treatment of a wide variety of infections, including meningitis caused by gram- negative enteric organisms, in both adults and chil- dren:' In one study, six of seven children with HIB meningitis (none ampicillin resistant) who were given moxalactam had a satisfactory clinical response.16 In a second report of 27 children with HIB meningitis treated with moxalactam, 26 survived and neurologie sequelae were noted in four. 19 None of these initial reports compared moxalactam with established antibiotics for the treatment of HIB meningitis. Moxalactam does not appear useful for the treatment of meningitis caused by gram-positive agents such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or group B streptococ- cus.",
            "Houston, Texas llAEMOPHILus INFLUENZAE TYPE B iS the most com- mon organism responsible for bacterial meningitis in children younger than 5 years. During the past 5 years in the United States, approximately 20% of H I B isolates have been resistant to ampicillin, t In some areas of the country, strains of HIB resistant to chloramphenicol have been reported? Furthermore, there have been isolates of ltlB resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol concomitant- ly?. 4 Therefore, alternative antibiotics must be available in the event that ampicillin-chloramphenicol-resistant strains of I{IB increase in incidence. Moxalactam is an one- oxa-/~-lactam antibiotic that is highly active in vitro against ItlB and penetrates into cerebrospinal fluid effec- tively? -s Previous studies have demonstrated that moxalac- tam is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of non-central nervous system infections caused by HIB in From the Departments of Pediatrics and Otorhinolaryngology, Baylor College of Medicine.
