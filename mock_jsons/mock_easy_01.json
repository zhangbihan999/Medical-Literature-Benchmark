Both groups were comparable in terms of clinical and laboratory findings at admission. The hospital course, neurologic sequelae including deafness, and number of deaths were the same for both groups.

Moxalactam at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day in four divided doses intravenously proved to be equivalent to ampicillin or chloramphenieol in the treatment of HIB meningitis in children. Moxalactam should not be used alone as the initial therapy of meningitis in children because of its relatively poor activity against S. pneumoniae. Aqueous penicillin G or ampicillin should be administered with moxalactam until the cause of the meningitis has been proved to be H. infl,tenzae type b. We continue to recommend ampicillin for the treatment of infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible HIB. Moxa- lactam should be considered a drug of choice for the treatment of meningitis caused by HIB resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Cefotaxime and ceftri- axone are two other cephalosporins that appear to be promising agents for the treatment of HIB meningitis. 2~ A more difficult question is the role of moxalactam and the other newer antibiotics in treating infections caused by ampicillin-resistant HIB. The known risks of chloram- phenicol as well as the recommendations to monitor serum levels are disadvantages to its use."
